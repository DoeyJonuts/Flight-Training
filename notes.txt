Features
    - Timer displaying current practicing tech
    - Leave additional time at the end to practice missed tech again
    - Include GIFs of current tech being practiced
    - Be able to highlight tech thats being missed and saved for later
    - Can use a switch statement or an array with each time as an index to simplify code

Concerns
    - Do we need to organize based on difficulty? How do we categorize ledegwork?
    - Do we create separate pages based on difficulty?
    - How do we capture the tech that was missed? Do we highlight it? Append to final timer? do we just let the user keep track?

Future Features
    - Daily Streak Tracker for each user
    - Edit tech training list

Randomize Code

function randomizeItems(items)
{
    var cached = items.slice(0), temp, i = cached.length, rand;
    while(--i)
    {
        rand = Math.floor(i * Math.random());
        temp = cached[rand];
        cached[rand] = cached[i];
        cached[i] = temp;
    }
    return cached;
}
function randomizeList()
{
var list = document.getElementById("myItems");
    var nodes = list.children, i = 0;
    nodes = Array.prototype.slice.call(nodes);
    nodes = randomizeItems(nodes);
    while(i < nodes.length)
    {
        list.appendChild(nodes[i]);
        ++i;
    }
list.style.display="block";
